## Projects

### Festorama
![Festorama](/img/Festorama.png)
Festorama was built for a one-day AngularJS and MongoDB team hackathon. I served as Project Manager and Git Master while focusing on the back-end and database. The app is a Futurama themed Festival search site. We had intended to add in the ability for users to join festivals and other users to group up for the festivals, but simply ran out of time.

### Contigo
